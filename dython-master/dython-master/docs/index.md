## Welcome!

Dython is a set of **D**ata analysis tools in p**YTHON** 3.x, which can let you get more insights about your data.

This library was designed with analysis usage in mind - meaning ease-of-use, functionality and readability are the core 
values of this library. Production-grade performance, on the other hand, were not considered.

**Here are some cool things you can do with it:**

Given a dataset, Dython will automatically find which features are categorical and which are numerical,
compute a relevant measure of association between each and every feature, and plot it all as an easy-to-read 
heat-map. And all this is done with a single line:

```python
from dython.nominal import associations
associations(data)
```
The result:

![associations_iris_example](images/associations_iris_example.png)

Here's another thing - given a machine-learning multi-class model's predictions, you can easily display
each class' ROC curve, AUC score and find the estimated-optimal thresholds - again, with a single line of code:

```python
from dython.model_utils import metric_graph

metric_graph(y_true, y_pred, metric='roc')
```
The result:

![roc_example](images/roc_example.png)

## Installation
Dython can be installed directly using `pip`:
```bash
pip install dython
```
Other installation options are available, see the [installation page](getting_started/installation.md)
for more information.

## Examples
See some usage examples of `nominal.associations` and `model_utils.roc_graph` on the [examples page](getting_started/examples.md).
All examples can also be imported and executed from `dython.examples`.

## Modules Documentation
Full documentation of all modues and public methods is available:

* [data_utils](modules/data_utils.md)

* [nominal](modules/nominal.md)

* [model_utils](modules/model_utils.md)

* [sampling](modules/sampling.md)
